Recruitment on Github

This python script allows you to find any contributors in any public repository on Github
  You'll get their "hireable" informations, their location, their email, their twitter and their blog if they have one.


If you need information on how does it works, feel free to contact me !

To use the script you need a Github Token (-t #token_number) that I can give you, then define which name does your export files will take (-c #file_name.csv). Then, define which Organization (-o #organization_name , e.g : grafana) and the repository you want to scrap (-r #repository_name , e.g : loki).
